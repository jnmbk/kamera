Algorithm may be like this:
* Check for USB webcams connected
* List possible webcams and let user select
* Send lsusb output to me when no camera is found and maybe take email address to notify user
* Install required driver package
* Show a webcam output window

Drivers to be checked:
* ov511
* qc-usb
